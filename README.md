[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/andela-cnwankwo/inverted-index/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/andela-cnwankwo/inverted-index?branch=develop)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andela-cnwankwo/inverted-index.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/andela-cnwankwo/inverted-index)

### Introduction
An inverted index (also referred to as postings file or inverted file) is an index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a database file, or in a document or a set of documents (named in contrast to a Forward Index, which maps from documents to content). The purpose of an inverted index is to allow fast full text searches, at a cost of increased processing when a document is added to the database. The inverted file may be the database file itself, rather than its index. It is the most popular data structure used in document retrieval systems.
